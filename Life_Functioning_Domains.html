<p>19 Colorado Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths 3.0</p><p>LIFE FUNCTIONING DOMAIN (AGES 6+)</p><p>Life domains are the different arenas of social interaction found in the lives of children, youth and their families. This domain rates how they are functioning in the individual, family, peer, school, and community realms. This section is rated using the needs scale and therefore will highlight any struggles the child/youth and family are experiencing.</p><p>Please rate the indicators in this domain for children/youth ages 6 and older. Question to Consider for this Domain: How is the child/youth functioning in individual, family, peer, school, and community realms?</p><p>For the Life Functioning Domain, use the following categories and action levels:</p><p>0 No evidence of any needs; no need for action.</p><p>1 Identified need that requires monitoring, watchful waiting, or preventive action</p><p>based on history, suspicion or disagreement.</p><p>2 Need is interfering with functioning. Action is required to ensure that the</p><p>identified need is addressed.</p><p>3 Need is dangerous or disabling; requires immediate and/or intensive action.</p><p>[Return to Table of Contents] [Return to Core Indicator List]</p><p>20 Colorado Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths 3.0</p><p>FAMILY FUNCTIONING</p><p>This indicator rates the child/youth’s relationships with those who are in their family. It is recommended that the description of family should come from the child/youth’s perspective (i.e. who the child/youth describes as their family). In the absence of this information, consider biological and adoptive relatives and their significant others with whom the child/youth is still in contact. Foster families should only be considered if they have made a significant commitment to the child/youth. For children/youth involved with child welfare, family refers to the person(s) fulfilling the permanency plan. When rating this indicator, take into account the relationship the child/youth has with their family as well as the relationship of the family as a whole.</p><p>Questions to Consider:</p><p>• Is there conflict in the family relationship that requires resolution?</p><p>• Is treatment required to restore or develop positive relationships in the family?</p><p>Ratings and Descriptions</p><p>0 No evidence of any needs; no need for action.</p><p>No evidence of problems in relationships with family members, and/or child/youth is doing well in relationships with family members.</p><p>1 Identified need that requires monitoring, watchful waiting, or preventive action based on</p><p>history, suspicion or disagreement.</p><p>History or suspicion of problems, and/or child/youth is doing adequately in relationships with family members, although some problems may exist. For example, some family members may have problems in their relationships with the child/youth. Arguing may be common but does not result in major problems.</p><p>2 Need is interfering with functioning. Action is required to ensure that the identified need is</p><p>addressed.</p><p>Child/youth is having problems with parents, siblings and/or other family members that are impacting their functioning. Frequent arguing, difficulty maintaining positive relationships may be observed.</p><p>3 Need is dangerous or disabling; requires immediate and/or intensive action.</p><p>Child/youth is having severe problems with parents, siblings and/or other family members. This would include problems of domestic violence, absence of any positive relationships, etc.</p><p>[Return to Table of Contents] [Return to Core Indicator List]</p><p>21 Colorado Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths 3.0</p><p>LIVING SITUATION</p><p>This indicator refers to how the child/youth is functioning in the child/youth’s current living arrangement, which could be with a relative, in a foster home, etc. This indicator should exclude respite, brief detention/jail, and brief medical and psychiatric hospitalization.</p><p>Questions to Consider:</p><p>• How has the child/youth been behaving and getting along with others in the current living</p><p>situation?</p><p>Ratings and Descriptions</p><p>0 No evidence of any needs; no need for action.</p><p>No evidence of problems with functioning in current living environment.

It includes age-appropriate behavior and the ability to make and sustain relationships. Social functioning is different from Interpersonal (Strengths) in that functioning is a description of how the child/youth is doing currently. Strengths are longer-term assets.</p><p>Questions to Consider:</p><p>• Is the child/youth pleasant and likeable?</p><p>• Do same age peers like the child/youth?</p><p>• Are there concerns about how the child/youth behaves in social settings?</p><p>Ratings and Descriptions</p><p>0 No evidence of any needs; no need for action.</p><p>No evidence of problems and/or child/youth has developmentally appropriate social functioning.</p><p>1 Identified need that requires monitoring, watchful waiting, or preventive action based on</p><p>history, suspicion or disagreement.</p><p>There is a history or suspicion of problems in social relationships.

Child/youth may have no friends or have constant conflict in relations with others, or have maladaptive relationships with others. The quality of the child/youth’s social relationships presents imminent danger to the child/youth’s safety, health, and/or development.</p><p>Supplemental Information: A child/youth who socializes with primarily younger or much older individuals would be identified as having needs on this indicator. A child/youth who has conflictual relationships with peers also would be described as having needs. An isolated child/youth with no same age friends would be rated ‘3.’</p><p>[Return to Table of Contents] [Return to Core Indicator List]</p><p>23 Colorado Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths 3.0</p><p>RECREATIONAL</p><p>This indicator rates the degree to which the child/youth is given access to and participates leisure activities.</p><p>Questions to Consider:</p><p>• How does the child/youth spend their free time?</p><p>• Are these activities a positive use of the child/youth’s free time?</p><p>• Are there barriers to participation in extracurricular activities for the child/youth?</p><p>• Does the child/youth often claim to be bored or have nothing to do?</p><p>Ratings and Descriptions</p><p>0 No evidence of any needs; no need for action.</p><p>No evidence of any problems with recreational functioning.
