  <h2>Cultural Factors Domain (All Ages)</h2>
  <p>These indicators identify linguistic or cultural issues for which service providers need to make accommodations (e.g., provide interpreter, find therapist who speaks family’s primary language, and/or ensure that a child/youth in placement can participate in cultural rituals associated with their cultural identity).</p>
  <p>Indicators in the Cultural Factors Domain describe difficulties that children and youth may experience or encounter because of their membership in any cultural group, and/or because of the relationship between members of that group and members of the dominant society.</p>
  <p>Health care disparities are differences in health care quality, affordability, access, utilization, and outcomes between groups. Culture in this domain is described broadly to include cultural groups that are racial, ethnic, or religious, or are based on age, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status and/or geography.</p>
  <p>It is important to remember when using the CANS that the family should be defined from the individual child/youth’s perspective (i.e., who the child/youth describes as part of their family). The cultural issues in this domain should be considered in relation to the impact they are having on the life of the child/youth when rating these indicators and creating a treatment or service plan.</p>
  <p>The indicators in this domain are rated for all ages. For ages 0–5, rate these indicators from the perspective of the family.</p>
  <h3>Question to Consider</h3>
  <p>How does the child/youth’s and/or their family’s membership in a particular cultural group impact their stress and well-being?</p>
  <h3>Action Levels</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>0</strong> – No evidence of any needs; no need for action.</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> – Identified need that requires monitoring, watchful waiting, or preventive action based on history, suspicion or disagreement.</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> – Need is interfering with functioning. Action is required to ensure that the identified need is addressed.</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> – Need is dangerous or disabling; requires immediate and/or intensive action.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Language and/or Literacy</h2>
  <p>This indicator looks at whether the child/youth and family need help with communication to obtain the necessary resources, supports and accommodations (e.g., interpreter). This includes spoken, written and sign language as well as issues of literacy.</p>

  <h3>Questions to Consider</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What language does the family speak at home?</li>
    <li>Is there a child/youth interpreting for the family in situations that may compromise the child/youth or family’s care?</li>
    <li>Does the child/youth or significant family members have any special needs related to communication (e.g., ESL, ASL, Braille, or assisted technology)?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ratings and Descriptions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>0</strong> – No evidence of any needs; no need for action. No evidence that there is a need or preference for an interpreter and/or the child/youth and family speak and read the primary language where they live.</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> – Identified need that requires monitoring, watchful waiting, or preventive action based on history, suspicion or disagreement. Child/youth and/or family speak or read the primary language where they live, but potential communication problems exist because of limited vocabulary or comprehension of the nuances of the language.</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> – Need is interfering with functioning. Action is required to ensure that the identified need is addressed. Child/youth and/or significant family members do not speak the primary language where they live. Translator or family’s native language speaker is needed for successful intervention; a qualified individual(s) can be identified within natural supports.</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> – Need is dangerous or disabling; requires immediate and/or intensive action. Child/youth and/or significant family members do not speak the primary language where they live.
