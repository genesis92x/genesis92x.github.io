<p>STRENGTHS DOMAIN (AGES 6+)</p>
<p>This domain describes the assets of the child/youth that can be used to advance healthy development. It is important to remember that strengths are NOT the opposite of needs. Increasing a child/youth’s strengths while also addressing their behavioral/emotional needs leads to better functioning, and better outcomes, than does focusing just on their needs. Identifying areas where strengths can be built is a significant element of service planning. In these indicators the ‘best’ assets and resources available to the child/youth are rated based on how accessible and useful those strengths are. These are the only indicators that use the Strength Rating Scale with action levels.</p>
<p>NOTE: When you have no information/evidence about a strength in this area, use a rating of ‘3.’</p>
<p>Please rate the indicators in this domain for children/youth ages 6 and older.</p>
<p>Question to Consider for this Domain: What child/youth strengths can be used to support a need?</p>
<p>For the Strengths Domain, use the following categories and action levels:</p>
<p>0 Well-developed, centerpiece strength; may be used as a centerpiece in an</p>
<p>intervention/action plan.</p>
<p>1 Identified and useful strength. Strength will be used, maintained or built upon</p>
<p>as part of the plan. May require some effort to develop strength into a</p>
<p>centerpiece strength.</p>
<p>2 Strengths have been identified but require strength-building efforts before they</p>
<p>can be effectively utilized as part of a plan. Identified but not useful.</p>
<p>3 An area in which no current strength is identified; efforts may be recommended</p>
<p>to develop a strength in this area.</p>

<p>FAMILY STRENGTHS</p>
<p>This indicator refers to the presence of a sense of family identity as well as love and communication among family members. Even families who are struggling often have a firm foundation that consists of a positive sense of family and strong underlying love and commitment to each other. These are the constructs this strength is intended to identify. As with Family Functioning, the definition of family comes from the child/youth’s perspective (i.e., who the child/youth describes as their family). If this information is not known, then we recommend a definition of family that includes biological/ adoptive relatives and their significant others with whom the child/youth is still in contact.</p>
<p>Questions to Consider:</p>
<p>• Does the child/youth have good relationships with any family member?</p>
<p>• Is there potential to develop positive family relationships?</p>
<p>• Is there a family member that the child/youth can go to in time of need for support? That can</p>
<p>advocate for the child/youth?</p>
<p>Ratings and Descriptions</p>
<p>0 Well-developed, centerpiece strength; may be used as a centerpiece in an intervention/action</p>

<p>Family has some good relationships and good communication. Family members can enjoy each other’s company. There is at least one family member who has a strong, loving relationship with the child/youth and can provide limited emotional or concrete support.</p>
<p>2 Strengths have been identified but require strength-building efforts before they can be</p>
<p>effectively utilized as part of a plan. Identified but not useful.</p>
