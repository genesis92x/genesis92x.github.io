INTRODUCTION 
THE CANS 
The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) is a multiple purpose information 
integration tool that is designed to be the output of an assessment process.  The purpose of the 
CANS is to accurately represent the shared vision of the child/youth serving system—children, 
youth, and families.  As such, completion of the CANS is accomplished in order to allow for the 
effective communication of this shared vision for use at all levels of the system.  Since its primary 
purpose is communication, the CANS is designed based on communication theory rather than the 
psychometric theories that have influenced most measurement development.  There are six key 
principles of a communimetric measure that apply to understanding the CANS. 
SIX KEY PRINCIPLES OF THE CANS 
1. Indicators were selected because they are each relevant to service/treatment planning. An 
indicator exists because it might lead you down a different pathway in terms of planning 
actions. 
2. Each indicator uses a 4-level rating system designed to translate immediately into action 
levels.  Different action levels exist for needs and strengths. For a description of these action 
levels please see below. 
3. Rating should describe the child/youth, not the child/youth in services. If an intervention is 
present that is masking a need but must stay in place, this should be factored into the rating 
consideration and would result in a rating of an “actionable” need (i.e., ‘2’ or ‘3’). 
4. Culture and development should be considered prior to establishing the action levels. 
Cultural responsivity involves considering whether cultural factors are influencing the 
expression of needs and strengths. Ratings should be completed considering the child/ 
youth’s developmental and/or chronological age depending on the indicator. In other words, 
anger control is not relevant for a very young child but would be for an older child and young 
adult regardless of developmental age. Alternatively, school achievement should be 
considered within the framework of expectations based on the child/youth’s developmental 
age. 
5. The ratings are generally “agnostic as to etiology.” In other words this is a descriptive tool; it 
is about the “what” not the “why.” While most indicators are purely descriptive, there are a 
few indicators that consider cause and effect; see individual indicator descriptions for details 
on when the “why” is considered in rating these indicators. 
6. A 30-day window is used for ratings in order to make sure assessments stay relevant to the 
child/youth’s present circumstances. The CANS is a communication tool and a measure of an 
individual’s story. The 30-day time frame should be considered in terms of whether an 
indicator is a need within the time frame within which the specific behavior may or may not 
have occurred.  The action levels assist in understanding whether a need is currently relevant 
even when no specific behavior has occurred during the time frame.

HISTORY AND BACKGROUND OF THE CANS 
The CANS is a multi-purpose tool developed to support care planning and level of care decision-
making, to facilitate quality improvement initiatives, and to allow for the monitoring of outcomes 
of services.  The CANS was developed from a communication perspective in order to facilitate the 
linkage between the assessment process and the design of individualized service plans including 
the application of evidence-based practices.  
The CANS gathers information on the child/youth’s and parents/caregivers’ needs and strengths.  
Strengths are the child/youth’s assets: areas in life where they are doing well or have an interest 
or ability.  Needs are areas where a child/youth requires help or intervention.  Care providers use 
an assessment process to get to know the child or youth and the families with whom they work 
and to understand their strengths and needs.  The CANS helps care providers decide which of a 
child/youth’s needs are the most important to address in treatment or service planning.  The CANS 
also helps identify strengths, which can be the basis of a treatment or service plan.  By working 
with the child/youth and family during the assessment process and talking together about the 
CANS, care providers can develop a treatment or service plan that addresses a child/youth’s 
strengths and needs while building strong engagement. 
The CANS is made up of domains that focus on various areas in a child/youth’s life, and each 
domain is made up of a group of specific indicators.  There are domains that address how the 
child/youth functions in everyday life, on specific emotional or behavioral concerns, on risk 
behaviors, on strengths and on skills needed to grow and develop.  There is also a domain that 
asks about the family’s beliefs and preferences, and about general family concerns.  The care 
provider, along with the child/youth and family as well as other stakeholders, gives a number 
rating to each of these indicators.  These ratings help the provider, child/youth and family 
understand where intensive or immediate action is most needed, and also where a child/youth 
has assets that could be a major part of the treatment or service plan. 
The CANS ratings, however, do not tell the whole story of a child/youth’s strengths and needs.  
Each section in the CANS is merely the output of a comprehensive assessment process and is 
documented alongside narratives where a care provider can provide more information about the 
child/youth.  
HISTORY 
The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths grew out of John Lyons’ work in modeling decision-
making for psychiatric services.  To assess appropriate use of psychiatric hospital and residential 
treatment services, the Childhood Severity of Psychiatric Illness (CSPI) tool was created.  This 
measure assesses those dimensions crucial to good clinical decision-making for intensive mental 
health service interventions and was the foundation of the CANS.  The CSPI tool demonstrated its 
utility in informing decision-making for residential treatment (Lyons, Mintzer, Kisiel, & Shallcross, 
1998) and for quality improvement in crisis assessment services (Lyons, Kisiel, Dulcan, Chesler, & 
Cohen, 1997; Leon, Uziel-Miller, Lyons, & Tracy, 1998).  The strength of this measurement 
approach has been that it is face valid and easy to use yet provides comprehensive information 
regarding clinical status.

Colorado Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths 3 0
The CANS builds upon the methodological approach of the CSPI but expands the assessment to 
include a broader conceptualization of needs and an assessment of strengths – both of the 
child/youth and the caregiver, looking primarily at the 30-day period prior to completion of the 
CANS.  It is a tool developed with the primary objective of supporting decision making at all levels 
of care: children, youth and families, programs and agencies, child/youth-serving systems.  It 
provides for a structured communication and critical thinking about children/youth and their 
context.  The CANS is designed for use either as a prospective assessment tool for decision support 
and recovery planning or as a retrospective quality improvement device demonstrating an 
individual child/youth’s progress.  It can also be used as a communication tool that provides a 
common language for all child/youth-serving entities to discuss the child/youth’s needs and 
strengths. A review of the case record in light of the CANS assessment tool will provide 
information as to the appropriateness of the recovery plan and whether individual goals and 
outcomes are achieved. 
Training and annual certification is required for providers who administer the CANS.  Additional 
training is available for CANS super users as experts of CANS administration, scoring, and use in 
the development of service or recovery plans. 
MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES 
Reliability 
Strong evidence from multiple reliability studies indicates that the CANS can be completed reliably 
by individuals working with children/youth and families. A number of individuals from different 
backgrounds have been trained and certified to use the CANS assessment reliably including health 
and mental health providers, child welfare case workers, probation officers, and family advocates. 
With approved training, anyone can learn to complete the tool reliably, although some 
applications or more complex versions of the CANS require a higher educational degree or 
relevant experience. The average reliability of the CANS is 0.78 with vignettes across a sample of 
more than 80,000 trainees. The reliability is higher (0.84) with case records, and can be above 0.90 
with live cases (Lyons, 2009). The CANS is auditable and audit reliabilities demonstrate that the 
CANS is reliable at the indicator level (Anderson et al., 2002). Training and certification with a 
reliability of at least 0.70 on a test case vignette is required for ethical use. In most jurisdictions, 
re-certification is annual. A full discussion on the reliability of the CANS assessment is found in 
Lyons (2009) Communimetrics: A Communication Theory of Measurement in Human Service 
Settings. 
Validity 
Studies have demonstrated the CANS’ validity, or its ability to measure children/youth’s and their 
caregiver’s needs and strengths. In a sample of more than 1,700 cases in 15 different program 
types across New York State, the total scores on the relevant dimensions of the CANS-Mental 
Health retrospectively distinguished level of care (Lyons, 2004). The CANS assessment has also 
been used to distinguish needs of children/youth in urban and rural settings (Anderson & Estle, 
2001). In numerous jurisdictions, the CANS has been used to predict service utilization and costs, 
and to evaluate outcomes of clinical interventions and programs (Lyons, 2004; Lyons & Weiner, 
2009; Lyons, 2009).  Five independent research groups in four states have demonstrated the 
reliability and validity of decision support algorithms using the CANS (Chor, et al., 2012, 2013, 
2014; Cordell, et al., 2016; Epstein, et al., 2015; Israel, et. al., 2015; Lardner, 2015).

RATING NEEDS & STRENGTHS 
The CANS is easy to learn and is well liked by children, youth and families, providers and other 
partners in the services system because it is easy to understand and does not necessarily require 
scoring in order to be meaningful to the child/youth and family. 
• Basic core indicators – grouped by domain - are rated for all individuals. 
• A rating of 1, 2 or 3 on key core questions triggers extension modules. 
• Individual assessment module questions provide additional information in a specific 
area. 
Each CANS rating suggests different pathways for service planning. There are four levels of rating 
for each indicator with specific anchored definitions.  These indicator level definitions, however, 
are designed to translate into the following action levels (separate for needs and strengths):  
Basic Design for Rating Needs 
Rating Level of need 
Appropriate action 
0 
No evidence of need 
No action needed 
1 
Significant history or possible 
need that is not interfering with 
functioning 
Watchful waiting/prevention/ 
additional assessment 
2 
Need interferes with functioning 
Action/intervention required 
3 
Need is dangerous or disabling 
Immediate action/intensive action 
required 
 
Basic Design for Rating Strengths 
Rating Level of strength 
Appropriate action 
0 
Centerpiece strength 
Central to planning 
1 
Strength present

2 
Identified strength 
Build or develop strength 
3 
No strength identified 
Strength creation or identification 
may be indicated 
 
The rating of ‘NA’ for ‘not applicable’ is available for a few indicators under specified 
circumstances (see reference guide descriptions).  For those indicators where the ‘NA’ rating is 
available, it should be used only in the rare instances where an indicator does not apply to that 
particular child/youth.  
To complete the CANS, a CANS trained and certified care coordinator, case worker, clinician, or 
other care provider should read the anchor descriptions for each indicator and then record the 
</pre>
<h2>Page 5</h2>
<pre>9 
Colorado Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths 3 0
appropriate rating on the CANS form (or electronic record).   This process should be done 
collaboratively with the child/youth, family and other stakeholders. 
Remember that the indicator anchor descriptions are examples of circumstances which fit each 
rating (‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’, or ‘3’).  The descriptions, however, are not inclusive and the action level ratings 
should be the primary rating descriptions considered (see above).  The rater must consider the 
basic meaning of each level to determine the appropriate rating on an indicator for an individual. 
The CANS is an information integration tool, intended to include multiple sources of information 
(e.g., child/youth and family, referral source, treatment providers, school, and observation of the 
rater).  As a strength-based approach, the CANS supports the belief that children, youth, and 
families have unique talents, skills, and life events, in addition to specific unmet needs.  Strength-
based approaches to assessment and service or treatment planning focus on collaborating with 
children/youth and their families to discover individual and family functioning and strengths.  
Failure to demonstrate a child/youth’s skill should first be viewed as an opportunity to learn the 
skill as opposed to the problem. Focusing on the child/youth’s strengths instead of weaknesses 
with their families may result in enhanced motivation and improved performance.  Involving the 
family and child/youth in the rating process and obtaining information (evidence) from multiple 
sources is necessary and improves the accuracy of the rating.  Meaningful use of the CANS and 
related information as tools (for reaching consensus, planning interventions, monitoring progress, 
psychoeducation, and supervision) support effective services for children, youth and families. 
As a quality improvement activity, a number of settings have utilized a fidelity model approach to 
look at service/treatment/action planning based on the CANS assessment.  A rating of ‘2’ or ‘3’ on 
a CANS need suggests that this area must be addressed in the service or treatment plan.  A rating 
of a ‘0’ or ‘1’ identifies a strength that can be used for strength-based planning and a ‘2’ or ‘3’ a 
strength that should be the focus of strength-building activities, when appropriate.  It is important 
to remember that when developing service and treatment plans for healthy child and youth 
trajectories, balancing the plan to address risk behaviors/needs and protective factors/strengths is 
key.  It has been demonstrated in the literature that strategies designed to develop child and 
youth capabilities are a promising means for development and play a role in reducing risky 
behaviors. 
Finally, the CANS can be used to monitor outcomes.  This can be accomplished in two ways.  First, 
CANS indicators that are initially rated a ‘2’ or ‘3’ are monitored over time to determine the 
percentage of individuals who move to a rating of ‘0’ or ‘1’ (resolved need, built strength).  
Dimension scores can also be generated by summing indicators within each of the domains 
(Behavioral/ Emotional Needs, Risk Behaviors, Functioning, etc.).  These scores can be compared 
over the course of treatment.  CANS dimension/domain scores have been shown to be valid 
outcome measures in residential treatment, intensive community treatment, foster care and 
treatment foster care, community mental health, and juvenile justice programs. 
The CANS is an open domain tool that is free for anyone to use with training and certification.  
There is a community of people who use the various versions of the CANS and share experiences, 
additional indicators, and supplementary tools.

HOW IS THE CANS USED? 
The CANS is used in many ways to transform the lives of children, youth, and their families and to 
improve our programs. Hopefully, this guide will help you to also use the CANS as a multi-purpose 
tool.   
IT IS AN ASSESSMENT STRATEGY 
When initially meeting clients and their caregivers, this guide can be helpful in ensuring that all the 
information required is gathered.  Most indicators include “Questions to Consider” which may be 
useful when asking about needs and strengths.  These are not questions that must be asked but 
are available as suggestions.  Many clinicians have found this useful during initial sessions either in 
person or over the phone (if there are follow up sessions required) to get a full picture of needs 
before treatment or service planning and beginning therapy or other services. 
IT GUIDES CARE AND TREATMENT/SERVICE PLANNING 
When an indicator on the CANS is rated a ‘2’ or ‘3’ (‘action needed’ or ‘immediate action needed’) 
we are indicating not only that it is a serious need for our client, but one that we are going to 
attempt to work on during the course of our treatment. As such, when you write your treatment 
plan, you should do your best to address any needs, impacts on functioning, or risk factors that 
you rate as a 2 or higher in that document.  
IT FACILITATES OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT 
The CANS is often completed every 6 months to measure change and transformation.  We work 
with children, youth, and families and their needs tend to change over time.  Needs may change in 
response to many factors including quality clinical support provided.  One way we determine how 
our supports are helping to alleviate suffering and restore functioning is by re-assessing needs, 
adjusting treatment or service plans, and tracking change. 
IT IS A COMMUNICATION TOOL 
When a client leaves a treatment program, a closing CANS may be completed to define progress, 
measure ongoing needs and help us make continuity of care decisions.  Doing a closing CANS, 
much like a discharge summary, integrated with CANS ratings, provides a picture of how much 
progress has been made, and allows for recommendations for future care which ties to current 
needs. And finally, it allows for a shared language to talk about our child/youth and creates 
opportunities for collaboration. It is our hope that this guide will help you to make the most out of 
the CANS and guide you in filling it out in an accurate way that helps you make good clinical 
decisions.  
CANS: A STRATEGY FOR CHANGE 
The CANS is an excellent strategy in addressing children and youth’s behavioral health care.  As it 
is meant to be an outcome of an assessment, it can be used to organize and integrate the 
information gathered from clinical interviews, records reviews, and information from screening 
tools and other measures.   
</pre>

It is a good idea to know the CANS and use the domains and indicators to help with your 
assessment process and information gathering sessions/clinical interviews with the child/youth 
and family.  This will not only help the organization of your interviews but will make the interview 
more conversational if you are not reading from a form.  A conversation is more likely to give you 
good information, so have a general idea of the indicators.  The CANS domains can be a good way 
to think about capturing information. You can start your assessment with any of the sections—Life 
Domain Functioning or Behavioral/Emotional Needs, Risk Behaviors or Strengths, or Caregiver 
Resources & Needs—this is your judgment call.  Sometimes, people need to talk about needs 
before they can acknowledge strengths.  Sometimes, after talking about strengths, then they can 
better explain the needs.  Trust your judgment, and when in doubt, always ask, “We can start by 
talking about what you feel that you and your child/youth need, or we can start by talking about 
the things that are going well and that you want to build on.  Do you have a preference?” 
Some people may “take off” on a topic.  Being familiar with the CANS indicators can help in having 
more natural conversations. So, if the family is talking about situations around the youth’s anger 
control and then shift into something like---“you know, he only gets angry when he is in Mr. S’s 
classroom,” you can follow that and ask some questions about situational anger, and then explore 
other school-related issues. 
MAKING THE BEST USE OF THE CANS 
Children and youth have families involved in their lives, and their family can be a great asset to 
their treatment.  To increase family involvement and understanding, it is important to talk to them 
about the assessment process and describe the CANS and how it will be used.  The description of 
the CANS should include teaching the child/youth and family about the needs and strengths rating 
scales, identifying the domains and indicators, as well as how the actionable indicators will be 
used in treatment or serving planning.  When possible, share with the child/youth and family the 
CANS domains and indicators (see the CANS Core Indicator list on page 16) and encourage the 
family to look over the indicators prior to your meeting with them.  The best time to do this is your 
decision—you will have a sense of the timing as you work with each family.  Families often feel 
respected as partners when they are prepared for a meeting or a process.  A copy of the 
completed CANS ratings should be reviewed with each family.  Encourage families to contact you if 
they wish to change their answers in any area that they feel needs more or less emphasis. 
LISTENING USING THE CANS  
Listening is the most important skill that you bring to working with the CANS.  Everyone has an 
individual style of listening.  The better you are at listening, the better the information you will 
receive.  Some things to keep in mind that make you a better listener and that will give you the 
best information: 
• Use nonverbal and minimal verbal prompts.  Head nodding, smiling, and a brief “yes,” 
“and”—things that encourage people to continue. 
• Be non-judgmental and avoid giving personal advice.  You may find yourself thinking “If 
I were this person, I would do x” or “That’s just like my situation, and I did x.”  But since 
you are not that person, what you would do is not particularly relevant.  Avoid making 
judgmental statements or telling them what you would do.  It’s not really about you. 
</pre>

Colorado Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths 3 0
• Be empathic.  Empathy is being warm and supportive.  It is the understanding of another 
person from their point of reference and acknowledging feelings.  You demonstrate 
empathic listening when you smile, nod, and maintain eye contact.  You also 
demonstrate empathetic listening when you follow the person’s lead and acknowledge 
when something may be difficult, or when something is great.  You demonstrate 
empathy when you summarize information correctly.  All of this demonstrates to the 
individual that you are with them. 
• Be comfortable with silence.  Some people need a little time to get their thoughts 
together.  Sometimes, they struggle with finding the right words.  Maybe they are 
deciding how they want to respond to a question.  If you are concerned that the silence 
means something else, you can always ask “Does that make sense to you?” Or “Do you 
need me to explain that in another way?” 
• Paraphrase and clarify—avoid interpreting.  Interpretation is when you go beyond the 
information given and infer something—in a person’s unconscious motivations, 
personality, etc.  The CANS is not a tool to come up with causes.  Instead, it identifies 
things that need to be acted upon.  Rather than talk about causation, focus on 
paraphrasing and clarifying.  Paraphrasing is restating a message very clearly in a 
different form, using different words.  A paraphrase helps you to (1) find out if you really 
have understood an answer; (2) clarify what was said, sometimes making things clearer; 
and (3) demonstrate empathy.  For example, you ask the questions about health, and the 
person you are talking to gives a long description.  You paraphrase by saying “OK, it 
sounds like . . . is that right?  Would you say that is something that you feel needs to be 
watched, or is help needed?” 
REDIRECT THE CONVERSATION TO THE PARENT’S/CAREGIVER’S OWN 
FEELINGS AND OBSERVATIONS 
Often, people will make comments about other people’s observations such as “Well, my mother 
thinks that his behavior is really obnoxious.”  It is important to redirect people to talk about their 
observations: “So your mother feels that when he does x that is obnoxious. What do YOU think?”  
The CANS is a tool to organize all points of observation, but the parent or caregiver’s perspective 
can be the most critical.  Once you have their perspective, you can then work on organizing and 
coalescing the other points of view. 
ACKNOWLEDGE FEELINGS 
People will be talking about difficult issues, and it is important to acknowledge that.  A simple 
acknowledgement such as “I hear you saying that it can be difficult when ...” demonstrates 
empathy. 
WRAPPING IT UP 
At the end of the assessment, we recommend the use of two open-ended questions.  These 
questions ask if there are any past experiences that people want to share that might be of benefit 
to planning for their young person, and if there is anything that they would like to add.  This is a 
good time to see if there is anything “left over”—feelings or thoughts that they would like to share 
with you.   
</pre>

Colorado Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths 3 0
Take time to summarize with the individual and family those areas of strengths and of needs.  Help 
them to get a “total picture” of the individual and family and offer them the opportunity to change 
any ratings. 
Take a few minutes to talk about what the next steps will be.  Now you have information 
organized into a framework that moves into the next stage—planning. 
So you might close with a statement such as:  “OK, now the next step is a “brainstorm” where we 
take this information that we’ve organized and start writing a plan—it is now much clearer which 
needs must be met and what we can build on.  So, let’s start. . .”
